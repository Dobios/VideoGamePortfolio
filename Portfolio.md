## Structure  

This portfolio contains all of my notable projects grouped into the following categories:  
 - Video Game Development  
 - Compupter Graphics and Vision    
 - Verification & Compiler Engineering  
 - Systems Programming & Hardware Development   

In each part, I highlight the impoprtant projects that I worked on in that field, both alone and in teams.   
Projects in each subject are ordered chronologically and cover Software and Hardware Research and Engineering work done over the past 10 years.
